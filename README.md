# CS 360: Mobile Architect & Programming  
## WeightWise App – Final Project Submission  

### Artifact Description  
This repository contains the completed app code design ZIP file developed for **Project Three** of CS 360. The project demonstrates my ability to develop a functional Android mobile application while applying mobile app development best practices and user-centered design principles. The repository includes the finalized UI design from Project Two and the complete implementation of the WeightWise weight-tracking app.

### Reflection  

#### App Requirements and Goals  
The goal of the WeightWise app was to create a simple and accessible tool that allows users to log their daily weight, view progress over time, and stay motivated to achieve their health and fitness goals. The app was designed to address user needs for organization, goal tracking, and easy visualization of progress. Its main purpose was to make weight management more convenient and engaging through an intuitive mobile experience.  

#### User Interface Design  
To meet user needs, the app included several core screens: a login page, dashboard, and entry form for adding new weight records. The UI design focused on simplicity, readability, and navigation ease. I used consistent color themes, logical spacing, and clearly labeled buttons to create a seamless flow between screens. By keeping the design clean and user-friendly, the app successfully minimized confusion and made daily interactions quick and efficient.  

#### Coding Approach  
I approached coding by breaking development into smaller, manageable steps. I used object-oriented programming to organize functionality, kept my code modular for easier debugging, and added comments to maintain readability. I also relied on Android Studio’s layout tools and emulator to iteratively test changes as I built each feature. These strategies helped me maintain a structured workflow and can be applied in future projects to improve efficiency and code quality.  

#### Testing and Validation  
I tested the app using the Android Studio emulator to verify that all screens and features worked as intended. Input validation was tested to ensure users could not enter invalid or empty data, and I checked that entries were stored and displayed correctly. Testing was important because it revealed small layout issues and logic errors that I was able to fix before final submission, ensuring that the app functioned smoothly.  

#### Innovation and Problem-Solving  
One challenge I faced was ensuring that data persisted correctly when users added new entries. I had to refine the database configuration and troubleshoot the connection between UI components and the backend logic. This required creativity, debugging, and patience to make sure the stored data updated in real time on the display screen.  

#### Demonstration of Knowledge and Skills  
I was particularly successful in demonstrating my understanding of user-centered design, app functionality, and clean coding practices. The final version of WeightWise integrates clear UI design with efficient backend logic, showing my ability to create a complete mobile solution from concept to deployment. Completing this project has strengthened both my technical and design skills and prepared me for future work in software and mobile app development.
